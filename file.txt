How Web Works Exercise

Part one: Solidify Terminology
In your own terms , define the following terms :

    -What is HTTP?
HTTP is a protocol commonly used to transfer information within a network of devices.

    -What us a URL?
URLs are used as the address for a web page and contain information about the current page

    -What is a DNS?
A DNS translates computer generated IP addresses from human readable domain names

    -What is a query string?
The query string is the part of the URL that assigns certain values based on the current page

    -What are two HTTP verbs and how are they different?
POST and GET , POST is for sending out information and GET is for retrieving information without altering it

    -What is a HTTP request?
HTTP requests are information requests declared with HTTP for retrieving data

    -What is an HTTP response?
The HTTP response is the result of the HTTP request , containing an HTTP status code or an error code

    -What is an HTTP header? Give a couple examples of request and response headers you have seen
An HTTP header provides information on the request or response 
request headers : Host , User-Agent , Accept
response headers : Content-type , Cache-Control , Last-Modified

    -What are the processes that happen when you type "https://somesite.com/some/page.html" into 
    a browser?
Protocol : https://
domain : somesite.com
path : /some/page.html 

DNS lookup , HTTP request , HTTP response , Resource loading / page display






PART TWO : Practice Tools

1. Using curl , make a GET request to the icanhazdadjoke.com API to find all jokes involving the 
word "pirate".

    paulo@ThisPC22:~$ curl -s "https://icanhazdadjoke.com/search?term=pirate"
    What does a pirate pay for his corn? A buccaneer!
    Why couldn't the kid see the pirate movie? Because it was rated arrr!
    What did the pirate say on his 80th birthday? Aye Matey!
    Why are pirates called pirates? Because they arrr!
    Why do pirates not know the alphabet? They always get stuck at "C".paulo@ThisPC22:~$

2. Use dig to find what the IP address is for icanhazdadjoke.com

    paulo@ThisPC22:~$ dig icanhazdadjoke.com

    ; <<>> DiG 9.18.18-0ubuntu0.22.04.1-Ubuntu <<>> icanhazdadjoke.com
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 60268
    ;; flags: qr rd ad; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

    ;; ANSWER SECTION:

    paulo@ThisPC22:~$



3. Make a simple web page and serve it using python3-m http.server. Visit the page in a browser.





PART THREE : Explore Dev Tools

Build a very simple html form that uses the get method (it can use the same page URL for the action)
when the form is submitted. 

(index.html)




Add a field or two to the form and, after submitting it , explore in chrome dev tools how you can 
view the request and response headers.

            Accept-Ranges:
            bytes
            Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:
            true
            Cache-Control:
            public, max-age=0
            Connection:
            keep-alive
            Content-Length:
            2024
            Content-Type:
            text/html; charset=UTF-8
            Date:
            Fri, 05 Apr 2024 05:56:55 GMT
            Etag:
            W/"213-18eacd49e30"
            Keep-Alive:
            timeout=5
            Last-Modified:

            Vary:
            Origin
            Accept:
            text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,image/avif,image/webp,image/apng,*/*;q=0.8,application/signed-exchange;v=b3;q=0.7

            Host:
            localhost:5500
            Referer:

            Sec-Fetch-Dest:

Edit the page to change the form type to POST , refresh the browser and re-submit. Do you still
see the field in the query string? Explore in chrome how you can view the request and response 
headers , as well as the form data.

            Accept-Ranges:
            bytes
            Access-Control-Allow-Credentials:

PART FOUR : Explore the URL API 

At times it's useful for your JavaScript to look at the URL of the browser window and change
how the script works depending on parts of that (particularly the query string).
Try some of the code examples in the chrome console so that you can get comfortable with the basic
methods and properties for instances of the URL class.
